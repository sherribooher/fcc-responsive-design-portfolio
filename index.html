            Hi! My name is Sherri, and I am a software developer in Atlanta,
            Georgia. My love of technology was born one Christmas morning when I
            received my very first computer as a gift from Santa. In the
            mid-90s, I taught myself HTML and CSS and began to craft basic
            websites for friends and family. Over the years, I also dabbled with
            JavaScript and jQuery, learning just enough to be dangerous.
            <br />
            <br />
            In 2017, I received my B.S. in Information Technology from Kennesaw
            State University, and shortly thereafter, I got my first job in the
            software industry, where I currently write code using VB.Net, C#,
            and SQL. I recently graduated from
            <a href="https://digitalcrafts.com"
              >DigitalCrafts' Full Stack Software Engineering program</a
            >, where I learned more about web technologies, languages, and
            frameworks than I ever thought possible! Having gained valuable
            skills over the years, I hope to now find and land my dream job with
            a company whose vision of the future aligns with my own. People can
            live better lives through the use of technology, and I hope to be a
            part of that in some way.
